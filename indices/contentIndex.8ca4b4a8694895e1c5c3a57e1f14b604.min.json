Also, I noticed the benefits of ultra-fasted cardio; an eating window would allow me to replenish protein and add weight training back to my routines.\n\nThe longest water fast I've done was for 3 days, I remember feeling energetic and satiated at the end of it; only stopped for dinner plans with some friends. That left me wondering since, could I have gone 5 days? Maybe longer? How would my body feel?\n\n**Do not attempt what I'm doing at home. Consult a medical professional first if you want to explore prolonged fasts.**\n\nI plan to make daily reflections and updates to this article, also for it to serve as an accountability tool. Also found [this guy](https://calathleticus.com/10-day-water-fast/) who did the same thing, he wrote much deeper reflections than I plan to.\n\n## Motivations\n\nThe health benefits of intermittent fasting are well documented at this point, my original 3-day water fast was done to reap the benefits of cellular autophagy (at 24 hrs+) and growth hormone release (at 36 hrs+), as well as some gut rest. **Arguably, a 3-day or 5-day water fast gives you all the potential health benefits, and can be done relatively safely.**\n\nA 10-Day Water Fast is more so to explore my own psychology and physiology.\n\nI also put on 10 pounds (4.54 kg) in the past month from stress eating, would be nice to shed some of that as well.\n\n## Goals\n\n* **Reset my tolerance** for caffeine and sugar, reset my gut microbiome.\n* **Exercise in discipline** and determination, push my own mettle.\n* **Lose whatever weight** in the process, no specific target.\n* **Capitalize on the productivity** boost from not needing to think about what to eat for a while.\n\t* Permaculture site design for my new farm.\n\t* EMBA coursework and prep for capstone project.\n\t* Training in GMB and WHM apprenticeships.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n* **Re-feeding syndrome**: this is the biggest safety item, I shall break the fast with some light bone broth and slowly work up to solid food over 24 hours. Immediately eating lots of food may be dangerous and even fatal in some cases.\n* **Muscle atrophy (wasting)**: the release of growth hormones at 36 hours should prevent muscle atrophy, so long as I maintain some level of non-strenuous activity.\n* **Clean fast and abort protocol**: For prolonged fasts, it is important to keep your gut asleep by only drinking water. Failing this, it is safer to abort the fast and slowly resume a regular diet, then attempt the prolonged fast another time.\n\t* Yes I know, black coffee/tea as well, but no herbal teas. Nothing that tastes like food, contains any calories, or raises insulin levels. However, I'm trying to reset caffeine tolerance as well.\n\n## Daily Updates\n\n### Day 0\n\nLast meal was some delicious ramen with my students, feeling energetic and ready to rock.\nHere are some pictures and stats I took earlier in the day for reference. Excited to see where I will be on day 10!\n\n![day0](images/Day0.jpg)\n![day0_weight](images/Day0_withings.jpg)\n\n### Day 1\n\nToday was actually full of surprises, had a last minute finance snafu on my farm offer and was scrambling to resolve that; it was the evening before I realized.\n\nEnergy levels were high, took an hour walk on the treadmill and going to bed after this. I've done 24hr fasts many times and everything feels normal so far.\n\n### Day 2\n\n**Felt a wave of hunger hit me about 30 hours into the fast**. After that, I no longer felt hunger, but rather just a feeling of emptiness in my stomach. From my experience, this should be the hardest part of the fast (at least for a 3-day).\n\nEnergy levels are great, **I did 90 mins of GMB training (think gymnastics mixed with yoga)** without feel extra strained, although I did fail miserably at my initial attempts at kick-up handstands.\n\nAlso drank too much water (to be fair it's the only thing I get to take) near bedtime, and remember feeling restless on bed, plus a bathroom trip mid-sleep. However, my Muse S EEG says that my **sleep quality was a whooping 89%**, which was a PB for me. There seems to be some validity to Bryan Johnson's claim that you sleep better while fasted.\n\n### Day 3\n\n**I broke my PB in WHM breath hold today at 4:03s**, I'd attribute it to the good sleep I had last night. Also, this is when some folks reported feeling cold during their fasts. I feel fine so far, and is still able to continue at 2x 1 min cold shower daily.\n\nCompleted three courses and an exam for my EMBA class and hit my productivity goals.\n\nI did read a lot more cautionary tales of mineral deficiency during water fasting, so I'm going to **add Athletic Greens (AG1) back on the menu**, which should supply me with all essential nutrients for each day. Here's to hoping it doesn't wake up my gut; don't want to hit the abort button until at least day 5.\n\nEnergy levels are good, no headaches or light-headedness, no fatigue (however I didn't do any exercise today). Feels just about how I felt last time 72 hours into the fast.\n\n### Day 4\n\nHad Athletic Greens in the morning, and **finished a 5 km run at my typical pace (90 hours into the fast)**. The run wasn't easier or harder than my normal 5 km runs that were either fed or (10 hr) fasted. I felt more comfortable with exercise after having replenished electrolytes in my body.\n\nOne very surprising turn of events: **had a bowel movement today**, probably what's leftover from before the fast. This also means that my gut likely woke up from the Athletic Greens supplement, so far I'm feeling fantastic but will monitor to see if I should abort after day 5.\n\nEnergy level were great, a mild hunger feeling has returned and lingers.\n\nOne thing was that my extremities were colder than normal (I have cold hands and feet to begin with), so I took a foot bath in the evening, and probably another one before bed.\n\n### Day 5\n\nI'm starting to feel hunger a lot more since my gut woke up, **decided to finish today and pivot the next 5 days into 20:4 intermittent fasting**. Part of this decision is also that when I took measurements this morning, my **body fat dropped by 1%** from the 5 km prolong fasted run, whereas my body composition was stable despite me being active and doing yoga etc.\n\nI believe that **the run forced my body to metabolize fat** (average HR 160bpm), and this **increased fat metabolism sustained for 24 hours**. Will be experimenting on this idea next, and it's seemingly very powerful (for me).\n\nIt's a workday today, so not much going on in terms of personal projects.\n\nDid **another 5 km run in the afternoon**, typical pace, 120 hours into the fast.\n\nAlso, **one hour swim in the evening, easy pace for 2500 m**, felt incredible after and almost makes me want to keep this up. However, let's stick to the adjusted plan. Only a night of sleep standup between me and great success for this segment.\n\nProgression pictures on the morning of day 6. The next 5 days will be geared towards fasted cardio/weight training into my eating window where I can replenish protein. The fasting **also fixed my ongoing high blood pressure issues**, which was sitting at 135/90 for a while.\n\n![day06](images/Day06.jpg)\n![day06_weight](images/Day06_withings.jpg)\n\n### Day 6\n\nI made a full 8qt of beef/radish/carrot broth today in my Ninja Foodi pressure cooker. **Drank only broth for the first 12 hours**, then worked to finish the whole pot by dinner. \n\nI barely added any salt or seasoning to the broth, but this **normally plain broth tasted rich with flavour**. Also threw two pieces of corn on the cob in there, which was some of the first carb and fibre I took over a long time.\n\n**Sleep was messed up as I took a 6-hour nap** (or you can call sleep at this point) 5-11 pm from the food, and another went to bed again at 2 am. Another bad note is that since I spent a lot of the day “eating”, I also spent a lot of time watching Twitch/YouTube and **wasn't very productive**. Old habits die hard.\n\n### Day 7\n\nFirst time in the morning, did my GMB initial assessments on dead-hang, chin-ups, shrimp squat, and bridge. Need to significant improve on each of those four move sets to graduate my trainer program.\n\nToday is the start of the Dota 2 Berlin Major, every time a major happens I end up taking extended walks on the treadmill while catching up with some of the games. **This time I decided to up do interval runs for some fasted cardio** in the AM, and was able to do similar output to my typical 5 km pace.\n\nFor my one meal, I ate a full Chicken Souvlaki plate with an extra piece of chicken thigh, plus an Iced Capp from Tim Hortons since I was out getting takeout and wanted coffee. In hindsight, that was **a massive mistake with 480 calories of sugar loaded consequences**.\n\nAlso **made some six-bean soy milk today using a cooking blender** (you have to presoak the beans overnight), it tasted amazing even without adding any sweeteners. I like doing soy milk this way since it keeps the pulp (fibre). It's a versatile way to get some beans intake without making chili all the time.\n\n**Gathered a strong team for my EMBA capstone project today**, lots of energy in the initial call and signs of great things to come. Truly, I've aligned five different efforts (BCIN, GMB, WHM, PDC, EMBA) towards making this wellness resort project happen. **As a sucker for synergies, I am invigorated**.\n\nNot tracking macros, but based on how I feel, I definitely ate too much today.\n\n### Day 8\n\nSome weight rebound, but that's to be expected as I regain the water weight by having glycogen in my body once again. The scale says it's lean mass and my body fat ratio has gone down, but personally **I feel a down-turn from how much I've been eating**.\n\nDid a one-hour indoor run this morning, and **by jogging/walking on intervals instead of fully spending myself on every jog segment, it feels as if I can continue for much longer**. This is reassuring for my upcoming half-marathon, at least finishing should be within my abilities.\n\nHad dinner with a friend and again, **ate way too much, I'll end up paying for it tomorrow morning with an extended run**, aiming for two-hours, and maybe three hours for a mock half-marathon on the last day.\n\nGoal for tomorrow: eat much less, move a lot more, and keep it in 4-hour eating window.\n\n### Day 9\n\ntodo: 2hr run, pdc assignment, capstone interviews, ","lastmodified":"2023-04-28T05:12:30.983457475Z","tags":["Personal","Fasting"]},"/contact":{"title":"Contact Us","content":"\nPlease fill the coaching inquiry form, we will reach out to you.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\n1.
