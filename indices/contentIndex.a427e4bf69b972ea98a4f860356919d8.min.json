That left me wondering since, could I have gone 5 days? Maybe longer? How would my body feel?\n\n\n**Do not attempt what I'm doing at home. Consult a medical professional first if you want to explore prolonged fasts.**\n\nI plan to make daily reflections and updates to this article, also for it to serve as an accountability tool. Also found [this guy](https://calathleticus.com/10-day-water-fast/) who did the same thing, he wrote much deeper reflections than I plan to.\n\n## Motivations\n\nThe health benefits of intermittent fasting are well documented at this point, my original 3-day water fast was done to reap the benefits of cellular autophagy (at 24 hrs+) and growth hormone release (at 36 hrs+), as well as some gut rest. **Arguably, a 3-day or 5-day water fast gives you all the potential health benefits, and can be done relatively safely.**\n\nA 10-Day Water Fast is more so to explore my own psychology and physiology.\n\nI also put on 10 pounds (4.54 kg) in the past month from stress eating, would be nice to shed some of that as well.\n\n## Goals\n\n* **Reset my tolerance** for caffeine and sugar, reset my gut microbiome.\n* **Exercise in discipline** and determination, push my own mettle.\n* **Lose whatever weight** in the process, no specific target.\n* **Capitalize on the productivity** boost from not needing to think about what to eat for a while.\n\t* Permaculture site design for my new farm.\n\t* EMBA coursework and prep for capstone project.\n\t* Training in GMB and WHM apprenticeships.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n* **Re-feeding syndrome**: this is the biggest safety item, I shall break the fast with some light bone broth and slowly work up to solid food over 24 hours. Immediately eating lots of food may be dangerous and even fatal in some cases.\n* **Muscle atrophy (wasting)**: the release of growth hormones at 36 hours should prevent muscle atrophy, so long as I maintain some level of non-strenuous activity.\n* **Clean fast and abort protocol**: For prolonged fasts, it is important to keep your gut asleep by only drinking water. Failing this, it is safer to abort the fast and slowly resume a regular diet, then attempt the prolonged fast another time.\n\t* Yes I know, black coffee/tea as well, but no herbal teas. Nothing that tastes like food, contains any calories, or raises insulin levels. However, I'm trying to reset caffeine tolerance as well.\n\n## Daily Updates\n\n### Day 0\n\nLast meal was some delicious ramen with my students, feeling energetic and ready to rock.\nHere are some pictures and stats I took earlier in the day for reference. Excited to see where I will be on day 10!\n\n![day0](images/Day0.jpg)\n![day0_weight](images/Day0_withings.jpg)\n\n### Day 1\n\nToday was actually full of surprises, had a last minute finance snafu on my farm offer and was scrambling to resolve that; it was the evening before I realized.\n\nEnergy levels were high, took an hour walk on the treadmill and going to bed after this. I've done 24hr fasts many times and everything feels normal so far.\n\n### Day 2\n\n**Felt a wave of hunger hit me about 30 hours into the fast**. After that, I no longer felt hunger, but rather just a feeling of emptiness in my stomach. From my experience, this should be the hardest part of the fast (at least for a 3-day).\n\nEnergy levels are great, **I did 90 mins of GMB training (think gymnastics mixed with yoga)** without feel extra strained, although I did fail miserably at my initial attempts at kick-up handstands.\n\nAlso drank too much water (to be fair it's the only thing I get to take) near bedtime, and remember feeling restless on bed, plus a bathroom trip mid-sleep. However, my Muse S EEG says that my **sleep quality was a whooping 89%**, which was a PB for me. There seems to be some validity to Bryan Johnson's claim that you sleep better while fasted.\n\n### Day 3\n\n**I broke my PB in WHM breath hold today at 4:03s**, I'd attribute it to the good sleep I had last night. Also, this is when some folks reported feeling cold during their fasts. I feel fine so far, and is still able to continue at 2x 1 min cold shower daily.\n\nCompleted three courses and an exam for my EMBA class and hit my productivity goals.\n\nI did read a lot more cautionary tales of mineral deficiency during water fasting, so I'm going to **add Athletic Greens (AG1) back on the menu**, which should supply me with all essential nutrients for each day. Here's to hoping it doesn't wake up my gut; don't want to hit the abort button until at least day 5.\n\nEnergy levels are good, no headaches or light-headedness, no fatigue (however I didn't do any exercise today). Feels just about how I felt last time 72 hours into the fast.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-23T03:07:19.54865911Z","tags":["Personal","Fasting"]},"/contact":{"title":"Contact Us","content":"\nPlease fill the coaching inquiry form, we will reach out to you.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\n1.
