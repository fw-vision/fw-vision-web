title: "10 Day Water Fast - An Experiment"
tags: [Personal, Fasting]

After planning for a bit, I've decided to do a 10-Day Water Fast (Apr 20 â€“ Apr 30, 2023).

The longest water fast I've done was for 3 days, I remember feeling energetic and satiated at the end of it; only stopped on dinner plans with some friends. That left me wondering since, could I have gone 5 days? Maybe longer? How would my body feel?


**Do not attempt what I'm doing at home. Consult a medical professional first if you want to explore prolonged fasts.**

I plan to make daily reflections and updates to this article, also for it to serve as an accountability tool. Also found [this guy](https://calathleticus.com/10-day-water-fast/) who did the same thing, he wrote much deeper reflections than I plan to.

## Motivations

The health benefits of intermittent fasting are well documented at this point, my original 3-day water fast was done to reap the benefits of cellular autophagy (at 24 hrs+) and growth hormone release (at 36 hrs+), as well as some gut rest. Arguably, a 3-day or 5-day water fast gives you all the potential health benefits, and can be done relatively safely.

A 10-Day Water Fast is more so to explore my own psychology and physiology.

I also put on 10 pounds (4.54 kg) in the past month from stress eating, would be nice to shed some of that as well.

## Goals

* Reset my tolerance for caffeine and sugar, reset my gut microbiome.
* Exercise in discipline and determination, push my own mettle.
* Lose whatever weight in the process, no specific target.
* Capitalize on the productivity boost from not needing to think about what to eat for a while.
	* Permaculture site design for my new farm.
	* EMBA coursework and prep for capstone project.
	* Training in GMB and WHM apprenticeships.

## Safety Notes

* **Re-feeding syndrome**: this is the biggest safety item, I shall break the fast with some light bone broth and slowly work up to solid food over 24 hours. Immediately eating lots of food may be dangerous and even fatal in some cases.
* **Muscle atrophy (wasting)**: the release of growth hormones at 36 hours should prevent muscle atrophy, so long as I maintain some level of non-strenuous activity.
* **Clean fast and abort protocol**: For prolonged fasts, it is important to keep your gut asleep by only drinking water. Failing this, it is safer to abort the fast and slowly resume a regular diet, then attempt the prolonged fast another time.
	* Yes I know, black coffee/tea as well, but no herbal teas. Nothing that tastes like food, contains any calories, or raises insulin levels. However, I'm trying to reset caffeine tolerance as well.

## Daily Updates

### Day 0

Last meal was some delicious ramen with my students, feeling energetic and ready to rock.
Here are some pictures and stats I took earlier in the day for reference. Excited to see where I will be on day 10!

### Day 1

Today was actually full of surprises, had a last minute finance snafu on my farm offer and was scrambling to resolve that; it was the evening before I realized.

Energy levels were high, took an hour walk on the treadmill and going to bed after this. I've done 24hr fasts many times and everything feels normal so far.

### Day 2
