title: "10 Day Water Fast - An Experiment"
tags: [Personal, Fasting]
---
After planning for a bit, I've decided to do a 10-Day Water Fast (Apr 20 – Apr 30, 2023).

> [!note]
> **Update:** After 136 hours of water fast, I've pivoted the remaining days to 20:4 intermittent fasting, with respect to some safety protocols I outlined in the beginning. Also, I noticed the benefits of ultra-fasted cardio; an eating window would allow me to replenish protein and add weight training back to my routines.

The longest water fast I've done was for 3 days, I remember feeling energetic and satiated at the end of it; only stopped for dinner plans with some friends. That left me wondering since, could I have gone 5 days? Maybe longer? How would my body feel?

**Do not attempt what I'm doing at home. Consult a medical professional first if you want to explore prolonged fasts.**

I plan to make daily reflections and updates to this article, also for it to serve as an accountability tool. Also found [this guy](https://calathleticus.com/10-day-water-fast/) who did the same thing, he wrote much deeper reflections than I plan to.

## Motivations

The health benefits of intermittent fasting are well documented at this point, my original 3-day water fast was done to reap the benefits of cellular autophagy (at 24 hrs+) and growth hormone release (at 36 hrs+), as well as some gut rest. **Arguably, a 3-day or 5-day water fast gives you all the potential health benefits, and can be done relatively safely.**

A 10-Day Water Fast is more so to explore my own psychology and physiology.

I also put on 10 pounds (4.54 kg) in the past month from stress eating, would be nice to shed some of that as well.

## Goals

* **Reset my tolerance** for caffeine and sugar, reset my gut microbiome.
* **Exercise in discipline** and determination, push my own mettle.
* **Lose whatever weight** in the process, no specific target.
* **Capitalize on the productivity** boost from not needing to think about what to eat for a while.
	* Permaculture site design for my new farm.
	* EMBA coursework and prep for capstone project.
	* Training in GMB and WHM apprenticeships.

## Safety Notes

* **Re-feeding syndrome**: this is the biggest safety item, I shall break the fast with some light bone broth and slowly work up to solid food over 24 hours. Immediately eating lots of food may be dangerous and even fatal in some cases.
* **Muscle atrophy (wasting)**: the release of growth hormones at 36 hours should prevent muscle atrophy, so long as I maintain some level of non-strenuous activity.
* **Clean fast and abort protocol**: For prolonged fasts, it is important to keep your gut asleep by only drinking water. Failing this, it is safer to abort the fast and slowly resume a regular diet, then attempt the prolonged fast another time.
	* Yes I know, black coffee/tea as well, but no herbal teas. Nothing that tastes like food, contains any calories, or raises insulin levels. However, I'm trying to reset caffeine tolerance as well.

## Daily Updates

### Day 0

Last meal was some delicious ramen with my students, feeling energetic and ready to rock.
Here are some pictures and stats I took earlier in the day for reference. Excited to see where I will be on day 10!

### Day 1

Today was actually full of surprises, had a last minute finance snafu on my farm offer and was scrambling to resolve that; it was the evening before I realized.

Energy levels were high, took an hour walk on the treadmill and going to bed after this. I've done 24hr fasts many times and everything feels normal so far.

### Day 2

**Felt a wave of hunger hit me about 30 hours into the fast**. After that, I no longer felt hunger, but rather just a feeling of emptiness in my stomach. From my experience, this should be the hardest part of the fast (at least for a 3-day).

Energy levels are great, **I did 90 mins of GMB training (think gymnastics mixed with yoga)** without feel extra strained, although I did fail miserably at my initial attempts at kick-up handstands.

Also drank too much water (to be fair it's the only thing I get to take) near bedtime, and remember feeling restless on bed, plus a bathroom trip mid-sleep. However, my Muse S EEG says that my **sleep quality was a whooping 89%**, which was a PB for me. There seems to be some validity to Bryan Johnson's claim that you sleep better while fasted.

### Day 3

**I broke my PB in WHM breath hold today at 4:03s**, I'd attribute it to the good sleep I had last night. Also, this is when some folks reported feeling cold during their fasts. I feel fine so far, and is still able to continue at 2x 1 min cold shower daily.

Completed three courses and an exam for my EMBA class and hit my productivity goals.

I did read a lot more cautionary tales of mineral deficiency during water fasting, so I'm going to **add Athletic Greens (AG1) back on the menu**, which should supply me with all essential nutrients for each day. Here's to hoping it doesn't wake up my gut; don't want to hit the abort button until at least day 5.

Energy levels are good, no headaches or light-headedness, no fatigue (however I didn't do any exercise today). Feels just about how I felt last time 72 hours into the fast.

### Day 4

Had Athletic Greens in the morning, and **finished a 5 km run at my typical pace (90 hours into the fast)**. The run wasn't easier or harder than my normal 5 km runs that were either fed or (10 hr) fasted. I felt more comfortable with exercise after having replenished electrolytes in my body.

One very surprising turn of events: **had a bowel movement today**, probably what's leftover from before the fast. This also means that my gut likely woke up from the Athletic Greens supplement, so far I'm feeling fantastic but will monitor to see if I should abort after day 5.

Energy level were great, a mild hunger feeling has returned and lingers.

One thing was that my extremities were colder than normal (I have cold hands and feet to begin with), so I took a foot bath in the evening, and probably another one before bed.

### Day 5

I'm starting to feel hunger a lot more since my gut woke up, **decided to finish today and pivot the next 5 days into 20:4 intermittent fasting**. Part of this decision is also that when I took measurements this morning, my **body fat dropped by 1%** from the 5 km prolong fasted run, whereas my body composition was stable despite me being active and doing yoga etc.

I believe that **the run forced my body to metabolize fat** (average HR 160bpm), and this **increased fat metabolism sustained for 24 hours**. Will be experimenting on this idea next, and it's seemingly very powerful (for me).

It's a workday today, so not much going on in terms of personal projects.

Did **another 5 km run in the afternoon**, typical pace, 120 hours into the fast.

Also, **one hour swim in the evening, easy pace for 2500 m**, felt incredible after and almost makes me want to keep this up. However, let's stick to the adjusted plan. Only a night of sleep standup between me and great success for this segment.

Progression pictures on the morning of day 6. The next 5 days will be geared towards fasted cardio/weight training into my eating window where I can replenish protein. The fasting **also fixed my ongoing high blood pressure issues**, which was sitting at 135/90 for a while.
